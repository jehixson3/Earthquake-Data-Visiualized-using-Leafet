Visualizing Data Earthquake data with Leaflet


Created a maps using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes and tectonis plates from their data set (geoJson) based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.  Legends provide context formap data.

A second data set on the map has been added related to tectonic plates to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.A number of base maps to choose from as well as separated out two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently with layer controls.
